                Recent research suggests that smartphone usage does indeed
                affect the brain. Remember, however, that such research is still
                in the early stages. While we know a bit more about some of the
                short-term effects, the long-term effects remain to be seen.Some
                evidence indicates that using mobile phones might lead to
                chemical changes in the brain. In one study presented to the
                Radiological Society of North America, researchers found that
                young people with a so-called internet and smartphone addiction
                actually demonstrated imbalances in brain chemistry compared to
                a control group.

                We use our phones for many things, from making business calls to
                checking our email to communicating with friends and loved ones.
                Our phones have become an inextricable part of our lives. But
                does this reliance on smartphones have any impact on our brains?
                Some recent research indicates that it might. Experts suggest
                that all of this phone use might affect our social and emotional
                regulation skills, disrupt our sleep, and turn us into lazy
                thinkers. Kids are also using these devices more and more, which
                has led experts to question the possible long-term effects on
                development. One study published in JAMA Pediatrics found that
                the amount of time kids spend staring at digital screens rose
                52% over a three-year period.1 How this might affect development
                remains to be seen. However, it is a question of interest for
                healthcare practitioners, mental health professionals,
                educators, parents, and anyone who uses a smartphone
                regularly.Setting specific limits on your phone use can be
                helpful. It's important to be purposeful about your mobile phone
                use, but you should also consider what works for you. For some
                people, this might involve removing certain apps from their
                phones. Others may find it helpful to use apps or phone settings
                to control how long they use certain apps or websites each day.
                Some people find that it is helpful to have phone-free times or
                even entire days. For example, you might decide you won't use
                your phone after 7 PM or on Saturdays so you can fully focus on
                the other people in your life.
